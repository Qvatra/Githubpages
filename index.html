                    <h5>
                        In 2D game graphics, a <strong>sprite</strong> is an animation that is integrated into a game background.
                        2D sprite animation is presented as a sequence of static key-frames and called a sprite sheet.
                        Sprite sheet usually contains all possible animations for a given character (or even for a game scene).
                        During runtime engine of a game uses a sprite sheet to select neened key-frames for a current animation.
                        The easiest way to make an animation and a sprite sheet is to use an animator.
                    </h5>

                    <h5>
                        Anatomy animator was developed to create 2D animated sprites and sprite sheets quickly and easily.
                        Animator represents sprite animation model as a skeleton that consist of adjustable bones.
                        Each bone represent movable part of a model and requires a texture. 
                        Each frame of an animation corresponds to a specific set of bone's coordinates.
                        This structure allows you to modify animation in a very efficient way.
                        Changing bone configuration modifies separate frame but changing texture configuration modifies bone appearence for an entire animation.                            
                        This makes it possible to re-use models applying different textures. 
                        Software automatically packs all frames of an animated sprite into a single sprite sheet image or saves animation as a set of frames.

                                    This feature allows you regardless your drawing skills or anatomy knowledge produce professional 2D animations.
                                    Software has 2 view panels: preview panel plays an animation in a loop while you do changes on the edit panel.
                                    As a result you can always see which tweaks make your animation look better.

                                    All movable parts of a model are represented as bones with textures.
                                    Replacing texture for a selected bone will automatically replace texture in an entire animation.
                                    This makes it possible to create different characters using the same model but different textures.

                                    This feature allows to create a transition state for a bone by averaging coordinates between two different key-frames.
                                    Transition is used for fast animation of model parts or could be applied to a whole frame to make the animation smoother.

                                    Software produces JSON formatted text file that contains all bones configurations for all frames.
                                    Game engine can use that info to combine all textures together according to a model.
                                    This might save you a lot of space especially if you have too many animations in a game scene.
